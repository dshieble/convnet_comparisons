This repository contains code to train neural networks with different layers and receptive field sizes on a number of different tasks in order to better understand the limitations of neural networks and the benefits of increasing depth and receptive field size.

Use the run_experiment.py script to train a network, and the analyze_experiment.py script to analyze the results of an experiment.
